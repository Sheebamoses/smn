# The Project to experiment Generative AI

This repository is for learning and experimentation purposes only

## The brief

The focus is on creating projects on new technology for understanding key concepts.

## Some hints
If you are new to Gradle, it may be worth spending 10 minutes reading a high level summary.  We are using the Gradle
Wrapper so `gradlew` from the command line should download everything you need.  Most modern IDEs support Gradle projects.

The use of JBehave in this instance is to provide you with our definition of done for the task.

Please ensure that you are familiar with our values in the instructions project.  They are important to us.
